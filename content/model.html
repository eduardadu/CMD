        The PhD program on Computational Media Design promotes autonomous learning through:
          <li>- Discussion of frontier themes in CMD research, in workshop, writing, critical revision and seminar activities;
          <li>- Project-based learning for immersive learning of research methods and techniques;
          <li>- Design challenges crafted for exploration of methods and collaboration;
          <li>- Design and running research processes, with interdisciplinary mentorship;
          <li>- External internships at selected international research labs and studios.
        </ul>

        The research challenges require the application of specific quantitative & qualitative research methods, enabling contextualized learning.
        <br>
        Development of project work in immersive design environments (laboratory & practice), guided by interdisciplinary design challenges, exercises the definition of research processes in design, fosters deep knowledge of research methods and computational instruments, and an appreciation of interdisciplinarity.
        Training of writing and communication, and critical reflection with peer reviewing activities, contributes to an explicit knowledge of research processes and results.
