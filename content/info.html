            Evaluation is a key educational activity in the teaching process and is meant to assess the skills and knowledge acquired by students, their critical thinking and ability to outline and solve problems, as well as their mastery of written and oral expression.
            <br>
            Eligible candidates to the exams must be enrolled in the corresponding course units in the academic year of such exams. If necessary, they must also register for those exams. The following are examples of evaluation: Written or oral exam, tests, and written or practical assignments, as well as individual or group projects possibly followed by an oral defence and participation in the seminar sessions. The evaluation process for each course unit may include one or more of the aforementioned evaluation instruments. Grades for each course unit are expressed on an integer scale from 0 to 20. Students must attain a minimum grade of 10 to pass a course unit. Whenever the evaluation of a course unit includes more than one evaluation instrument, the final grade will be calculated from the individual grades attained for each evaluation instrument, following a formula published in the course unit sheet.
