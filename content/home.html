    Digital + Media (D+M) operates at the nexus of art and technology creating a framework for students to discover emergent creative practices and make research-driven, critically informed work.
    Offered at the graduate level only, the program encourages degree candidates to explore many mediums, such as sound, land and the body, and to challenge the social constructs that produce and are enforced by new technologies.
