          The Research Methodologies in Computational Media Design aims for the student to:
          <li> Acquire a broad view of the interdisciplinary research domain of Computational Media Design.
          <li> Develop specific knowledge of the research challenges and main applicable methodologies, of the new objects of design, of the evolution of design practices, of organizing research processes, and of advanced forms of interdisciplinary reflection in Design.
          <li> Improve competencies of critical analysis of scientific works, synthesis, scientific writing, verbal and written communication, critical reasoning, autonomous learning, research and collaborative work.     
        </ul>

        <ul class="list">
        Research challenges and methodological approaches in Computational Media Design, including:
          <li> Computational Creativity, computational models and methods in Design;
          <li> Human-Computer Interaction, models, methods, technologies and results;
          <li> Design, Communication and Social Innovation;
          <li> Research into new design objects (Media, Services, Sociotechnical Transitions);
          <li> Perception and Cognition: research methods and instruments;
          <li> Design and new media criticism, emergent literatures and literacies;
          <li> Methodological confluences in artistic and scientific practices;
          <li> Design Research, designerly ways of knowing, and research through design;
          <li> Ethics and scientific integrity
          <li> Research designs and interdisciplinary reflexion in Design;
          <li> Qualitative methodologies (narrative, ethnographic, phenomenological, GT, case study) and mixes;
          <li> Content Analysis; data collection, coding, analysis, validity, trust and criticism;
          <li> Scientific communication.
        </ul>
        Dealing with challenges and methods in the areas of Computational Creativity and HCI, exploring perspectives of Perception and Cognition, Communication, Media Criticism and Literatures, and Artistic practices, contributes towards a broad vision of the interdisciplinary research domain.
        <br>
        The understanding of project practices, of the specificity of reflexive design discourse, of design as research, and of research methods in the field of design, enables the student to become capable to frame research challenges and how to apply research methods to the study of processes and new objects of design.
        Moreover, it enables the evolution of practices, of the organization of research processes, and of interdisciplinary Design reflection.
        <br>
        The treatment of data collection, analysis, and validation techniques, and of scientific communication, enable development of critical analysis, communication, autonomous learning and colaborative work competences.

          In the Thesis Project unit, the student deepens the knowledge of a particular research topic, to identify problems to be considered, methods to solve them, and to prepare a written proposal for the research work to develop within the Thesis, which must include:
            <li>The presentation of the objective of the thesis, including the topic to be investigated
            <li>The contextualization of that topic within Computational Media Design, the state of the art and prospects of development of scientific knowledge in the relevant area
            <li>The potential contribution of the thesis to the scientific knowledge in the area
            <li>The work plan to accomplish the objective of the thesis.
          </ul>

          Each student will be followed in the identification and selection of a topic of interest for which the program can provide a supervisor.
          The initial monitoring is carried out by the Program Coordination, until the assignment of a supervisor, possibly temporary, during the first semester.
          Reading the bibliography suggested by the supervisor and the autonomous search for supplementary bibliography contribute to the subsequent specification of the purpose of the thesis, contextualization of the research topic, and knowledge of the state of the art.
          <br>
          Performing preliminary research work should allow the potential of the ideas proposed and their feasibility to be assessed.
          The student will submit, in the end of the first half of the course, a preliminary proposal, which will be presented and defended in a workshop.
          This accompanying measure is intended to take students to share their experience and check their progress, and also serves as preparation for the final defense.

        The Thesis unit's main objective is the development of scientific research work leading to the preparation of an original dissertation in the area of Computational Media Design, on the topic defined in the Thesis Project.
        Competencies to be developed: Instrumental: analysis and synthesis, organization and planning, oral and written communication, knowledge in the area of studies, decision making.
        Personal: ability to work in an international context, ability to understand other experts, critical thinking. Systemic: self-learning, creativity, concern with quality, self-criticism and self-assessment, research.
          <br>
        The student carries out his individual research work towards the elaboration of the thesis in articulation with the supervisors, framed by a research team. Students participate annually in a workshop organised by the Doctoral Program by presenting and discussing the work done so far.
        The doctoral examination consists of the public discussion of the thesis, which must be original. No other forms of assessment apply
          <br>
        Each student will be supervised by a qualified teacher and his will be framed in a research team from the area of your thesis, as well as in a research center with dynamics and resources that facilitate their work.
         He will count, therefore, with a proper context for the development of his work. The annual workshop, where the student will present and discuss the status of his work, provides an additional opportunity for tracking and monitoring his progress and also to provide an opportunity to share his experience and to prepare for the final defense.
